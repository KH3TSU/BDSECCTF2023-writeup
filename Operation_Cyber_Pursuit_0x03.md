## Operation Cyber Pursuit 0x03
```
A critical update has surfaced in the ongoing investigation.
According to Ishtiaq, the esteemed OSINT expert, Hax0r BD, the elusive cybercriminal,
conducted their activities outside Bangladesh until recently.
Officer Ishtiaq also suggested that the hacker might come to the country soon,
possibly after July 14. Your mission is to determine the city/state where Hax0r
BD was located before this pivotal date. With time running short, you must utilize
your investigative expertise to uncover the hacker's previous whereabouts. Every clue
matters as you piece together the puzzle and race against the clock to identify
the city that housed Hax0r BD before their anticipated arrival in Bangladesh.
