## Find Leader

Noman Prodhan, the leader of Knight Squad, is not his real name. In 2021, he worked for a company and expressed his gratitude to the CEO of that company. Can you please provide the real name of Noman Prodhan along with the name of the CEO he is thankful to?

## How To Get This Flag?

_**1. Getting the Real Name.**_

As I knew Noman was not his real name, I embarked on a quest through the realm of social media profiles. I sought profiles where the same lastname was used with a different firstname or the same firstname was used with a different lastname. After careful sleuthing, I found the following profiles that turned out to be his true identity:

- Facebook: Noman Prodhan
- Instagram: Noman Prodhan
- Linkedin: Moniruzzaman Prodhan

Thus, I uncovered the real name: Moniruzzaman Prodhan.

_**2. Getting the CEO's Name.**_

On Linkedin, I made a serendipitous discovery â€“ a certificate with the CEO's name, Janet Legere. To be thorough, I cross-verified the certificate on Facebook, where I stumbled upon a telling message:

```
It has been an honor to work for CLB Learning.
Janet is very friendly and a great employer.
Thanks to Janet as well as The Contact List Builder for the certificate.
```
