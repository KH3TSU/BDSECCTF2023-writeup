## Operation Cyber Pursuit 0x00 
```
The digital world trembled under the relentless reign of Hax0r BD,
 a mysterious cybercriminal whose identity remained shrouded in secrecy.
 With each masterful hack, Hax0r BD struck fear into the hearts of individuals
and organizations alike. The magnitude of their cyber attacks left the authorities
 baffled, prompting the Detective Branch (DB) of the Bangladesh Police to launch a
dedicated operation to apprehend this elusive hacker.

For years, Hax0r BD had effortlessly evaded capture,
leaving no trace of their digital presence. Their genius
in manipulating systems and exploiting vulnerabilities
remained unparalleled. As their reputation grew, so did
the DB's determination to expose their true identity and bring them to justice.

DB investigators, driven by an unyielding pursuit of truth,
pieced together fragments of Hax0r BD's activities. It became
evident that the hacker reveled in the thrill of their exploits,
taking delight in showcasing their cyber prowess. However, their
 true persona remained hidden behind an impenetrable digital curtain.

The DB team understood that to unmask Hax0r BD's true identity,
 they needed the collective expertise of the OSINT community.
It was clear that social media held the key to unravelling this enigma.
Though the hacker's presence on Facebook had been ruled out, DB intelligence,
including inputs from the Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) Intelligence
 and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), confirmed that there was no trace of
 Hax0r BD's activity on Facebook or any connections to the hacker.

Now, the DB team reaches out to you, talented OSINT investigators,
seeking your assistance in the quest to expose Hax0r BD's hidden social media accounts.
As the first challenge of Operation Cyber Pursuit, your task is to scour the digital landscape,
leveraging your skills and intuition to unearth the hacker's alternative online presence.
